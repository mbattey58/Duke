# Installation

1. `git clone` this repository

1. install gems in Gemfile

1. launch the application

1. run rspec

1. **BONUS** write a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file to run the server,
   rake, rails c, rspec, etc. for local development.

# Running tests

We use RSpec for our automated tests. You must write tests for your code
according to the following standard:

- spec/models: specifications for any models that you create
- spec/requests: specifications for all requests against the application
- **BONUS** avoid hard-coding test artifacts such as created objects, request
  parameters, etc.

# Problems to be solved

As you work through these problems, please **commit your code early and often**.
A good rule of thumb is to make small commits grouped by specific functionality.

## Problem 1 REST backend

You have been provided assignment.apib, and assignment.html (a human readable version).
Using the existing Rails api application framework, implement the requirements specified in assignment.apib.
